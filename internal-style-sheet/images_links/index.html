<h1> Hello World!</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<h2> A Place I'd Like To Visit </h2>

<p> A place that I would like to visit is <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/visit-seoul-things-to-know" target="_blank" >
    Seoul, South Korea.</a>
    I'd want to go here because I am interested in
eastern Asian countries, but I am particularly interested in the deeply rooted traditions in Korea, as well as the
contemporary culture there. They also have amazing food!</p>

<h2> A Person I Admire <br> (Past or Present) </h2>

<p> A person that I admire is my elder sister, Xinh. I admire her because despite all of the hardships she has
had to face in her life, she is still one of the most courageous, giving, and kind people I know.</p>
